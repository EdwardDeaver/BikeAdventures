  A friction shifter attached to Tektro brake hoods, a system agnostic shifter
  that sits in a strange place in 2025. In a world of microSHIFT, Shimano Cues
  and a rising Chinese domestic market shifter brands why would you get these?
  Friction for all of it's aero disadvantages, usability disadvantages has a
  “just works” value that is hard to overstate.

Hit the hill, pull the lever left, a cacophony of gears clank as the chain rips upwards on the cogset, spin, spin, spin, crest, lever middle right, spin the flat, get up, pull right, speed up.

Yes you can drop gears on an STI shifter but as fast? No\*

Are they aero? No.

Are they as ergonomic as STI shifters? No.\*\*

Are they a conversation starter? Yes.\*\*\*

\*In most situations

\*\* Fit is more important with these than STIs due to being on top of the hoods.

\*\*\* From those curious and those who know.

In the Summer of 2021 I was rebuilding a LeMond Poprad Disc, stripped it to the fork and frame and recreated it - a SRAM NX 1x, a MicroShift Advent X derailleur and cogset, chiseled carbon fiber seat post out, and kept the Avid BB7 road disc brakes. And [Gevenalle CX shifters](https://www.gevenalle.com/shifters/).

## The construction

It's a Tektro brake mechanism with a microSHIFT friction shifter attached to it. The tightening screw for the hoods is located behind the brake inside the hood, behind the cable if it's there. Though it doesn't happen often adjusting that screw is a pain, you need to really finesse an allen key in there and be ok with rubbing - having to remove the cable seems cumbersome. 

### The hoods

Shimano hoods are smooth, the Tektro ones are textured which in some aspects is nice for grip but on long rides where you're holding on for hours they can irritate your hands and if you rest middle of your thumb and index finger on it it will hurt after a while.

## A conversation starter:

These are different. On one of my first Syracuse Bike Party rides a person recognized them, after that those moments are few but those who know want to talk about them and people are curious about shifters that look different.  

## Actually using them:

They're fine, they feel out of place on the road but fine on gravel. They're incredible simple, it's not complex with how they work. With a 10 speed it is possible to be in between gears causing you to miss-shift but just get a 13 speed cassette, lol jk, though I've read at 12 speed friction almost feels like indexed. Changing gears causes the brake lever to start to dip a bit, if this was hydraulic I imagine that'd be an issue but these are cabled. Overall I'm happy to continue using them, they've survived many crashes at this point and cheers to many more. 

Another friction competitor as emerged [https://velo-orange.com/products/growtac-equal-shifting-control-lever?variant=45038552809647](https://velo-orange.com/products/growtac-equal-shifting-control-lever?variant=45038552809647) Growtac's Control Lever. They operate more similar to a brifter using non-standard parts to create something new. Would love to try these someday, but they're quite expensive.
